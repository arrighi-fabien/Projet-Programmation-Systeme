# UML Diagram Descriptions

## Activity Diagram
The Activity Diagram graphically represents the control flow of a process. It details how events are triggered based on the system's states. This diagram is essential for understanding the sequence of activities and decisions in the process.

## Class Diagram
The Class Diagram outlines the system's structure, modeling classes, attributes, methods, and their relationships. It is crucial for understanding the system's design and interaction between its parts. In our class diagram:
- **Green** indicates the **Program** itself.
- **Red** represents the **Controller** components.
- **Violet** is used for the **View** components.
- **Blue** denotes the **Model** components.

Each attribute has a public property defining its getters and setters, promoting encapsulation and efficient data management.

## Sequence Diagram
This diagram visualizes the interactions between different actors or components of the system over time. It highlights the chronological sequence of message exchanges to accomplish specific functions, illustrating the dynamic behavior of the system.

## Use Case Diagram
The Use Case Diagram provides a high-level overview of the system's functionality and its interaction with external users (actors). It shows the possible actions users can perform and how the system responds, facilitating a clear understanding of requirements and functionalities.
